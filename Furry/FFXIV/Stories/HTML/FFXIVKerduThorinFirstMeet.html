<p class="subtitle"><p>Tales of the Two Hrothgar’s</p>
<p>Kerdu [Athorin/PyrePaw] – AJH657</p></p>
</header>
<p>“Vermilion Scourge!” Lovro ann Slanasch shouted as The Western
Plateau of Zadnor shook from his powerful red mage spell that was a
convergence of white and black magic.</p>
<p>The explosion flew the resistance members currently taking part in
this ambush of Lorvo ann Slanasch into the air before sending them
cratering back down.</p>
<p>Behind them was Kerdu Athorin running towards the skirmish with his
gunblade dragging the ground with sparks flying and tempering the blade
red hot with friction. Nearing the downed resistance members Kerdu threw
a Lightning Shot at Lovro disorientating the tempered Gunnhildr's
Blade.</p>
<p>Kerdu quickly surveyed the downed members for a healer. Quickly
spotting a Hrothgar White Mage nearly knocked out. Focusing on his blade
Kerdu made it glow in a cyan hue.</p>
<p>“Aurora!” Kerdu cast a spell and pointed his blade at the Hrothgar
making the restorative energy float towards him.</p>
<p>“Blade. what is your name?” Kerdu asked the recovering Hrothgar and
extending a helping hand.</p>
<p>“Blade Otsokosch. Thank you for helping. What is your name?” Thorin
answered and taking the hand to help himself up.</p>
<p>“Blade Athorin. You should get everyone up and retreat to the camp. I
can stall him until you all retreat.” Kerdu commanded while reloading
his gunblade and eyeing Lovro.</p>
<p>As Kerdu charged at Lovro Thorin weaved multiple restorative spells
over the downed members that lit up the battlefield that was covered by
darkness of night. With the many explosions of Kerdu’s Gunblade ringing
in the background Thorin got all the resistance members retreating to
the camp. He turned his attention to Lovro and Kerdu’s battle.</p>
<p>The battle was going badly with Kerdu’s gunblade out of cartridges
and dropped on the ground with Lovro holding him in the air by his
throat. Lovro is channeling a spell into his rapier. Thorin sends out a
tether to rescue Kerdu from Lovro.</p>
<p>“This is the end of another enemy of Queen Gunnhildr.” Lovro yells
and stabs Kerdu in a gap between his body armor and leggings with the
rapier</p>
<p>As Lovro’s rapier impales into Kerdu is infected by the spell and
starts to drain his aether. Thorin’s tether latching onto Kerdu
transferred a part of the spell to back to Thorin.</p>
<p>While being dragged back to Thorin by his rescue tether Kerdu picked
up his Gunblade from the ground. Kerdu tried to reengage Lovro’s spell
had weakened both Thorin and Kerdu.</p>
<p>“We… need to retreat… Blade Athorin.” Thorin shouted while gasping
for air.</p>
<p>“Fine. If you can channel The Return to Camp Vrdelnis I can stall
Lovro.” Kerdu responded begrudgingly.</p>
<p>“You shall not escape the judgement of Queen Gunnhildr.” Lovro yelled
at the pair of Hrothgar’s.</p>
<p>Thorin began channeling Return as Kerdu began throwing Lightning
Shots at Lovro to keep him staggered. With each Lightning Shot Kerdu
strength grew weaker and while Thorin was concentrating to the Return
spell his strength was also growing weaker.</p>
<p>Lovro had reached Kerdu, and both of their blades were sparking when
they clashed.</p>
<p>“Get closer NOW!” Thorin yelled as the spell was nearing
completion.</p>
<p>Kerdu flip jumped back to Thorin using Lovro’s chest as the
springboard. Landing near Thorin and grasping him just in time to be
whisked away in the return spell. Arriving at Camp Vrdelnis Aetheryte
both passed out exhaustion.</p>
<p>Kerdu yelps as he jolts awake. He quickly notices that he is on a bed
in a tent in Gangos with Thorin laying down next to him in another bed
still asleep. Bajsaljen walks over to the tent.</p>
<p>“Ok what happened?” Bajsaljen sternly questioned Kerdu while leaning
onto the pole in the tent.</p>
<p>“Thorin’s squad ran into Lovro, I tried to help them by stalling
Lovro, and he stabbed me with some kind of spell on his rapier’s tip and
Thorin contracted it making it danger him.” Kerdu ashamedly summarized
the events while avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>“Hey! You do not need to feel any sorrow about that you did your job.
All Thorin’s squad members arrived safely to the camp soon after you
were sent back here.” Bajsaljen responded and his raised voice jolted
Thorin awake. “You should now rest. We will need our best warrior fully
rested for the assault of The Dalriada.”</p>
<p>“The healer’s told me that both of you were lucky that only your
internal aether’s flow stability was compromised. It should clear out in
a few days.” Bajsaljen explained. “Now both of you take some rest. Maybe
head to Kugane. I heard their Dango platters are sweet.”</p>
<p>“Hey. I think we should follow that advice. I can cover the costs…”
Kerdu asked Thorin with a hint of shame.</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure I haven’t spent that much time in Kugane only when
passing through it because the Eorzean ships only go there.” Thorin
answered.</p>
<p>“Oh. are you Eorzean too?” Kerdu perked up.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Twelveswood.” Thorin answered.</p>
<p>“Oh neat. I mostly spend my time at Revenant's Tolls, but I have a
house in The Lavender Beds” Kerdu replied.</p>
<p>“Oh neat, but we should get going the flight to Kugane will be long.”
Thorin answered looking at the airship on the dock.</p>
<p>The airship flight was spent mostly Kerdu and Thorin sleeping. When
they arrived Kugane they made their way to The Shiokaze Hostelry and
ordered multiple platters of Dango. Finding available seating on the
upper floors they waited for their order.</p>
<p>“Hey. I got to ask what Bajsaljen means by you being our best
warrior.” Thorin asked while getting closer look to Kerdu.</p>
<p>“Umm… I have some special abilities that has in his eyes elevated me
to the ‘best warrior status’.” Kerdu mumbled to Thorin.</p>
<p>“Wait! You said that you spend most of your time at Revenant’s Toll.
Are you by any chance a warrior of light.” Thorin questioned Kerdu.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Kerdu muttered defeatedly.</p>
<p>“Wow. I have only heard about Warrior of light’s when there is talk
about that one was assisting The New Gunn Gunnhildr’s blades before they
got tempered at the Castrum Lacus Litore.”</p>
<p>With Thorin blurting Kerdu realized that Thorin doesn’t know he is
The Warrior of light. With this newfound secrecy Kerdu started to feel
more relaxed as he could be more himself and not have the title of The
Warrior of Light, raising expectations through the roof. With the Dango
order’s arrival and Thorin distracted by the multicolored Dango’s Kerdu
thought it would be a good idea to ask Thorin about his opinion about
himself</p>
<p>“Interesting. What do you think about them?” Kerdu asked while
relaxing his stance.</p>
<p>“I admit he is an awesome figure head for us, but enough about that.
I want to know all about your adventures.” Thorin answered and
immediately threw another question at Kerdu.</p>
<p>“Well. I have been mostly adventuring. Visiting many interesting
places. Helping here and there.” Kerdu answered.</p>
<p>“Ooh what place was the most interesting to you?” Thorin asked and
leant closer as his interest grew.</p>
<p>“This place in a faraway land called Novrandt. The colors of the
flora and fauna there were so unique to anything I have ever experienced
and how strong the determination of the people” Kerdu answered with
nostalgic melancholy in his voice.</p>
<p>“Wow. That sounds cool that sound like a cool place to visit. Maybe I
should visit that place someday.” Thorin wondered while being enthralled
by Kerdu’s description of Novrandt.</p>
<p>“I wish more people could people could visit that place, but it is
really difficult to access.” Kerdu lamented.</p>
<p>“What about you? Have you visited any interesting places?” Kerdu
turned to question Thorin.</p>
<p>“I haven’t done much adventuring or travelled that much. Before all
this Bozja stuff I spent most of time in the Twelveswood helping people
and elementals alike.” Thorin shied away from the answer.</p>
<p>“Well… The adventure for me at least is something that calls me out
of interest or someone needing help. Also, they don’t need to be
anything epic. Anything can be an adventure. Like for example I had an
exciting adventure only in Lavender beds when a neighbor moved in, and I
helped him to decorate his house.” Kerdu tried to cheer up Thorin.</p>
<p>Making the current situation awkward Kerdu tried to think of
something to change the subject. Then an idea came to Kerdu’s head</p>
<p>“Speaking of the lavender beds if you want to spend the nights
somewhere more comfortable you can visit my house.” Kerdu murmured. “I
think my current beds will beat any inn bed that I have come
across.”</p>
<p>“Wow. Thank you. Why offer me this to me a stranger that you met…
like a sun ago?” Thorin asked while leaning in closer to Kerdu.</p>
<p>“Well, sometimes when I am not adventuring, I get a bit lonely.”
Kerdu muttered as he stood up.</p>
<p>“Now. I think we should go get more food to fill our bellies.” Kerdu
asked as he extended his hand to Thorin.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that sounds good.” Thorin answered while taking Kerdu’s hand
and standing up.</p>
<p>With many plates strewn across their table from their feast of many
Dango and empty fish stew bowls, Tea glasses and plates of
Chirashi-zushi. Kerdu was finishing his last strip of Jerked Jhammel he
heard the footsteps of a familiar Midlander Hyur approaching him and as
he turned to look at the approaching Hyur there was no mistaking with
those rose-tinted spectacles on his face who it was.</p>
<p>“Well. if it isn’t Hancock. How we may be in service of your
profits?” Kerdu spoke with extremely thinly vailed distain.</p>
<p>“Ahh… I still miss that Eorzean bluntness. How is the magnanimous
warrior of light doing and who is this fine gentleman with you?” Hancock
greeted them.</p>
<p>Thorin wildly was confused who was this Hyur that Kerdu knew and why
did he call Kerdu THE warrior of light not A warrior of light?</p>
<p>“This is Thorin an associate of mine, but enough about that what do
you want with us?” Kerdu deflected Hancock’s pleasantries and stood up
directly in front of Hancock blocking his view of Thorin.</p>
<p>“Well, I have some news for you and your associate. There are some
whispers on Garlean lips about an unexpected visit by a larger cat and
some six-legged drones to a nice little camp that you care for so much
in Zadnor in about 4-6 bells.” Hancock calmly whispered to Kerdu.</p>
<p>Kerdu realizing that it was a warning about an incoming attack on
Camp Vrdelnis, he pulled out his book of Field Records and looked
through the attack plans for today. Kerdu’s panic grew as he realized
that the camp might be vulnerable to an attack as most of the members
would be on deployments.</p>
<p>“Thorin. We need to go. NOW!” Kerdu shouted at Thorin.</p>
<p>“What is going o-” Thorin tried to question but was interrupted by
Kerdu dragging him up from the table.</p>
<p>Both ran down the stairs of The Shiokaze Hostelry with Kerdu mostly
leaping down the stairs to get down faster. Quickly running through the
Tasogare Bridge and arriving to The Short Pier’s airship landing they
saw a male Roegadyn of the Bozjan resistance loading supplies to an
airship.</p>
<p>“Hey! Are these supplies going to Zadnor?” Kerdu yelled as they
approached the Roegadyn.</p>
<p>“Ah. Blade Athorin. Yes, they are. Is there something wrong?”
Roegadyn asked Kerdu.</p>
<p>“Not- yet. But we need to get to- Zadnor as fast as possible.” Kerdu
stammered in a panicked state.</p>
<p>“Well. You are in luck because I am just about to leave. Hop on.”
Roegadyn invited them on.</p>
<p>Nearing the end of flight Kerdu took a few cylinders of depleted
cartridges from his bandolier. A few lightning and fire aspected aether
crystals from his back pocket. He started to transfer the aether of the
crystals to the cartridges.</p>
<p>“What are you doing now?” Thorin inquired from Kerdu.</p>
<p>“I am using the crystals to charge my cartridges, so I don’t use my
personal aether while in this poisoned state.” Kerdu answered back while
concentrating on the aether transfer.</p>
<p>“Umm… There is a one question that I must ask.” Thorin murmured to
Kerdu.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. What is it.” Kerdu mumbled while packing his left-over
items.</p>
<p>“So are you THE warrior-” Thorin tried to ask but was cut off by the
Roegadyn.</p>
<p>“Heads up! We are landing now!” Roegadyn shouted at them.</p>
<p>Kerdu immediately turned his sights onto Camp Vrdelnis. Leaping from
the airship while it was still lowering itself to the ramp. He ran with
Thorin following him behind towards Marsak who was talking to another
resistance member.</p>
<p>“Hey! What are you doing here. You should be resting.” Marsak yelled
at Kerdu. “And why did you bring Blade Otsokosch also back with
you?”</p>
<p>“Look. I know but I got intel of a possible surprise attack to this
camp and came here to defend it.” Kerdu hastily describing the
situation.</p>
<p>“Now could be a good time to attack us I give you that.” Marsak
agreed.</p>
<p>As those words came out of Marsak’s lips the air bombardment on Camp
Vrdelnis shield increased to nothing that was ever felt before.</p>
<p>“There is a Hrothgar, about twelve 4<sup>th</sup> legion Hexadrones
and few soldiers are approaching the camp.” A Miqo'te Bard yelled out
who was on the lookout.</p>
<p>“Look. I am so sorry for dragging you into this, but we need a healer
now. So would you help me.” Kerdu pleaded with Thorin.</p>
<p>“Certainty. We all are in this together.” Thorin responded while
drawing out his Cane.</p>
<p>“Kerdu. Take this.” Marsak said to Kerdu while handing out a Gunblade
Cartridge with “Gunmetal soul” etched to the side to Kerdu.</p>
<p>“What! No. Not now! We planned to use this on the Dalriada raid!”
Kerdu yelled as he looked at the cartridge.</p>
<p>“If the camp falls it will be no use for anything.” Marsak yelled
back. “We can come up with another plan.”</p>
<p>Kerdu slid the cartridge into his pocket. A party of those few people
that were at the camp gathered at the only bridge that went into The
Southern Plateau. Kerdu and Thorin moved to the front of the party. The
Hrothgar leading the attack squad was Lovro ann Slanasch. Both Kerdu and
Thorin were shocked but soon the anger in both rose higher than the
shock of seeing him.</p>
<p>“Gha-ha-ha. What a fortunate encounter. I can finally administer long
evaded judgement of Queen Gunnhildr upon you two and take down this
pathetic camp of the false ‘New’ Queen Gunnhildr’s blades at once.”
Lovro monologued.</p>
<p>“Blades. Attack!” Marsak ordered and began charging at the
enemies.</p>
<p>Kerdu immediately charged at Lovro with him swinging his blade
wildly. Giving Marsak and the others an opening to get behind Lovro and
Kerdu to attack the other soldiers.</p>
<p>Kerdu pressed the trigger on his Gunblade letting out an explosion
caused by a cartridge and making the blade glow. He used the potential
energy of the cartridge to propel the blade faster towards Lovro. The
blade skipping across Lovro’s chest piece with sparks flying everywhere.
The Gunblade after leaving Lovro’s chest piece embedded itself onto the
metal of the bridge they were standing on.</p>
<p>Lovro countered with an attempted stab in the weak point between
Kerdu’s Body armor and leggings missing it by few ilms. Kerdu responded
with a quick punch to Lovro’s lower jaw.</p>
<p>An explosion of white magic on the right side of Lovro sent him
staggering backwards a few yalms. As Kerdu closed the distance between
Lovro threw six Fleche rapiers at Thorin. As the rapiers pierced Thorin
he fell down for the count.</p>
<p>Seeing this made Kerdu furious. He pointed his blade towards the sky
and pulled the trigger. A beam of light extended from the tip of his
Gunblade and Kerdu slammed it back to the ground with Lovro in the line
causing many explosions to happen along the line and kicking up a
massive cloud of dust.</p>
<p>Kerdu tried to look for Lovro in the dust cloud but found a tether
latching onto him. Lovro pulled on the tether and closed the cap between
them. As Lovro neared he shoulder charged Kerdu sending him flying next
to Thorin. When Kerdu fell to the ground the gunmetal soul cartridge
flew from his pouch rolling in front of Lovro’s feet. Kerdu tried to
stand up again but the aether poisoning had gotten worser again, falling
back down as he took one step towards Lovro.</p>
<p>“What do we have here? This was going to save the shield from Queens
Hexadrones?” Lovro monologued while inspecting the cartridge.</p>
<p>“We can’t have that even attempted.” Lovro belittled as he threw the
cartridge off the side of the bridge.</p>
<p>“Now. Here is what is going to happen: I will destroy this little
camp, then I am going to kill you traitors starting with this healer and
finishing off with you the one who didn’t accept the light of the Queen
in the chambers of Castrum Lacus Litore.” Lovro continued his
monologue.</p>
<p>“Drones! Take aim!” Lovro stepped back and raised his hand to prepare
for the bombardment order. “Fire!”</p>
<p>As the Hexadrones charged their missiles Kerdu punched the ground as
he was so furious about losing somebody that he had formed some kind of
connection. Using this rage to pull himself up and picked up his
Gunblade. An energy coursed through him feeling like he could transcend
his limits fueled by his rage. He pointed his Gunblade above the enemy
forces. He took a deep breath as he gathered the leftovers of what
remained his personal aether pool to add to the power of his spell.</p>
<p>“Gunmetal Soul!” Kerdu roared as he pulled the trigger of his
Gunblade three times.</p>
<p>Three sets of glowing hexagonal shields shot out forming a domed
shield around Kerdu and Thorin. As the dome fully formed the drones shot
out their missiles reflecting them back and blowing out the tops of the
drones clean off with their own missiles.</p>
<p>Lovro was horrified as his drones were reduced to rubble and his
soldiers were defeated by Marsak’s squad.</p>
<p>“What are you!?” Lovro shouted the question to Kerdu.</p>
<p>“I am the warrior of light… and the children of Bozja… are under my
protection” Kerdu answered with his remaining strength.</p>
<p>With Lovro still furious and being corned from behind by Marsak’s
squad he decided to swiftly cast an aero spell under him kicking up more
dust concealing his teleport away.</p>
<p>Kerdu fell to the ground from exhaustion. Thorin and Marsak rushed to
his side.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry I am here for you now.” Thorin yelled as he started to
channel a healing spell upon Kerdu.</p>
<p>“I will be fine. I just need to take a nap.” Kerdu grasped Thorin’s
hand stopping the healing spell.</p>
<p>As those words left Kerdu’s lips he passed out again. Waking in an
infirmary back in Gangos he saw Thorin sitting next to him on a chair
looking concerned. When Kerdu took a big breath of air Thorin leaped
up.</p>
<p>“Kerdu! are you ok? how many fingers am I holding up.” Thorin
questioned Kerdu while holding up his fingers.</p>
<p>“Three. I think?” Kerdu answered still a bit dazed.</p>
<p>“Thank The Twelve.” Thorin prayed while leaning in for a hug.</p>
<p>“I thought I lost you.” Thorin shouted at Kerdu while grasping his
hand.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you say anything about being The Warrior of Light.”
Thorin asked while tears started to run down his face.</p>
<p>“I… umm… wanted to for you to see me as me but not the title.” Kerdu
muttered.</p>
<p>“Well, I can tell you the legends never told anything about this kind
of softness that I have experienced from you.” Thorin sobbed while
looking at Kerdu.</p>
<p>Kerdu stood up sitting on his bed and extended his arms around Thorin
to comfort him.</p>
<p>“There is one question I want to ask from you.” Kerdu whispered to
Thorin’s ear.</p>
<p>“Why do you even need to ask me that! after all that you have done
you don’t think you are entitled to questions.” Thorin shouted at Kerdu
while clearing tears from his eyes.</p>
<p>“Would you like to spend some time together with me with me when all
this Bozja and Zadnor stuff is done?” Kerdu muttered with some blushing
appearing from beneath his fur.</p>
<p>“Of course. The time spent with you is some of the greatest time that
I have ever spent with somebody.” Thorin whispered back to Kerdu’s
ear.</p>
<p>As the sun fell over the horizon Thorin leaned in for a kiss on
Kerdu’s cheek sending his tail wagging in many different directions.
Kerdu responding with a kiss of his own back to Thorin’s cheek.</p>
<p>The End</p>
