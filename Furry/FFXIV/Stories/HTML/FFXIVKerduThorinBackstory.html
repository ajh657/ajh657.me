</header>
<p>It was a stormy evening at The Lavender Beds. Everyone else was
huddled inside their homes except for one Hrothgar who was running from
the ferry of the lavender beds back to plot number 9. With a Luncheon
bag kept close to his chest and held atop him was a parasol with a
flaming red moon to prevent the bag from getting soggy.</p>
<p>He was running through the gates on the front stairs of the property
and skipping along the large stones in the front yard. As he made it
inside, he placed the bag on a small table next to the front door, the
parasol inside the umbrella stand, and his coat on the rack.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Kerdu! Are you down there? I brought some food with me.” Thorin
yelled out as he looked around, searching the upper floor for Kerdu.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah! Just tinkering with my Gunblade.” Kerdu shouted back.</p>
<p>Kerdu was downstairs sitting on the floor sofas in front of The
Phasmascape of an aurora in the Coerthan fields.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Do you by any chance have a proper umbrella anywhere?” Thorin
asked.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Umm. I think one of my retainers has it. I must ask them when they
get here tomorrow.” Kerdu stopped the maintenance of his
half-disassembled Gunblade to wonder aloud.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I must ask. Is it safe to stare at those towers?” Thorin cautiously
asked as he went down the stairs.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I think yes. They temper by proximity like any other primals. Why?”
Kerdu answered in a bit of confusion.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Phew. Some people at Camp Tranquil were staring at the one in Shroud
for many bells.” Thorin sighed in relief.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Ooh. What did you bring? It smells delicious.” Kerdu inquired as he
smelt the aromas emanating from the luncheon bag.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Your favorite Jerked Jhammel and for me some Warrior’s soup.” Thorin
showcased as he took them out.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Just set it down on the table. I’ll finish the repairs.” Kerdu
dismissively ordered at the table while focusing on his Gunblade.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What did it already break? What did you do this time?” Thorin asked
in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Nothing this time! I think…” Kerdu hesitantly defended himself,
trying to remember all that he had done after his previous repair.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Remember the Hyur Regana at the resistance?” Kerdu quizzed
Thorin.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Wasn’t she the one who tried to scam the resistance with the
exorbitant prices for materials for the Resistance weapons?” Thorin
tried to recall.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah her. Because of his extortion, we used a cheaper part on one of
this blade’s firing mechanisms. I had to contract an Ul’dahn Hyur
goldsmith to finish this part.” Kerdu explained while handing over the
nearly broken old part.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“By the looks of it, you were close to shattering it.” Thorin
remarked while inspecting it. “Here, have it back.”</p>
<p>Thorin tossed the part back to Kerdu, but Thorin tossed it at an
unusual angle, causing Kerdu’s grip on his Gunblade to slip. Attempting
to prevent the half-disassembled from falling to the ground, he
accidentally grabbed it at the blade, causing him to cut himself.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Seven Hells!” Kerdu cursed in pain and clutched his hand in
pain.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hey! Let me look at it.” Thorin ordered as he moved closer to
Kerdu.</p>
<p>Thorin grabbed Kerdu’s hand and began channeling a restorative spell
on the wound. In a few seconds, the wound started to close causing Kerdu
to yelp in pain.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hey! That hurt, you could have warned me before healing it.” Kerdu
whined at Thorin.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What!? The mighty Warrior of Light is complaining about a small
cut.” Thorin questioned in bewilderment. “I have seen your back. it
looks like a scratching post there.”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Well… Those wounds happen during the thrill of the battle” Kerdu
muttered. “Might you have some numbing salve?”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“No… I don’t think so.” Thorin answered while inspecting his
pockets.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Aww… My father used to have this amazing numbing salve.” Kerdu
reminisced while caressing his new scar.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh. Was he Chirurgeon?” Thorin wondered aloud.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I think he was a Conjurer, being Roegadyn they have some natural
attunement to magicks.” Kerdu answered.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, your father was a Roegadyn” Thorin was surprised at the
revelation. “So… did you grow up with one blood parent?”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Unfortunately, I was just left with my adoptive parents by a Bozjan
shaman with my name on a piece of a letter” Kerdu reminisced. “The only
words she gave them, ‘Protect him well. He will be a guiding star one
day.’”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“My guess is that the shaman foresaw all my warrior of light stuff.”
Kerdu Speculated.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh… You didn’t even know them.” Thorin said somberly while getting
closer to Kerdu. “How are your adoptive parents now?”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Well… They went missing during seventh umbral calamity when one of
Bahamut’s flare landed in my village and there was a massive fire that
raged through the village.” Kerdu reminisced and slouched lower. “Then I
spent around 5 years on the streets.”</p>
<p>Thorin leaned in to give Kerdu a hug. Kerdu accepted the hug but was
confused at Thorin’s sudden empathy.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Look. I know I had it rough but why are you being this soft?” Kerdu
asked Thorin “What was your childhood like?”</p>
<p>Kerdu looked closer at Thorin and noticed that he was trying to hold
his crying. Kerdu hugged Thorin hard and started to pet him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Is everything all right-” Kerdu tried to comfort Thorin but was
interrupted by him.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“WHY! Why were you speared from the pain of seeing them disappear!?”
Thorin shouted while tears started to roll down his face. “Why is every
victory handed to you!?”</p>
<p>Kerdu was taken aback by the sudden mood switch. Thorin pushed Kerdu
away knocking him on his back. Kerdu got up and saw Thorin holding his
face while the tears rolled down between his fingers.</p>
<p>Kerdu was able to hug him again, causing Thorin to scratch his sides
in frustration. Kerdu didn’t relent this time letting Thorin tire
himself out on him. Thorin hit a few of Kerdu’s back scars in his fit of
rage.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Why are you doing this?” Thorin sobbed “Please go away before
something bad happens.”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“No!” Kerdu shouted “Something is clearly with you, and I am not
leaving until this is solved.”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Please” Thorin pleaded “I don’t want to hurt you.”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Just take your anger of me out on me.” Kerdu ordered while hugging
him stronger.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, Thorin had exhausted himself and was now lying
in Kerdu’s lap. Still breathing heavily and somewhat intermittently.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“So. Let’s try this again.” Kerdu said while petting Thorin. “What
did happen in your childhood? You don’t have to tell me but I’m here to
help.”</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I had blood parents. They were part of the Bozjan underground
resistance at the time of Garlean occupation.” Thorin explained “They
were protecting an escape escort at an underground tunnel…”</p>
<p>As those words passed Thorin lips Kerdu’s echo activates transporting
him to the eyes of very young Thorin looking in the opposite direction
of the slow-moving cart and noticed a shine of light at the near end of
the tunnel.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Papa. Look! Light.” Thorin whispered to a stoic Hrothgar Gunbreaker
in the traditional Bozjan carbs.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Honey. I think we have company!” The Gunbreaker shouted at a female
Hrothgar in what looked like a conjurer’s carbs.</p>
<p>The excitement that Thorin felt at that moment seeing his parents
getting ready for action and grabbing a smaller conjurer’s cane to cheer
his parents along.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Look sweetie. Thorin wants to help as well. Now we will never lose
to them.” The Hrothgar Gunbreaker said while preparing for the
attack.</p>
<p>The smugness of the Hrothgar Gunbreaker quickly faded as a Magitek
Scorpion entered the tunnel. The Gunbreaker charged at the Scorpion to
stall its advance at the cart. Gunblade explosions rang out in the
tunnel and wind magicks flowed with grace along the tunnel. Battles
favor turned to worse when another Scorpion entered tunnel. The two
Hrothgar’s gathered under a protective bubble to formulate a plan.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“This tunnel is getting sealed. You guys pick up the speed.” The
Gunbreaker shouted. “Also get Thorin away from the view. Things are
getting messy.”</p>
<p>Another Hrothgar picked up Thorin away from the edge as the speed of
cart picked up. Thorin tussled with him wanting to see his parents in
action. Only a getting to see the mortified face of him as Thorin heard
the tunnel collapsing. There weren’t any more explosions or magical
sounds after that and Thorin started to tear up as he realized what had
happened.</p>
<p>As Kerdu’s echo vision ended Thorin was looking at him with a worried
expression. Kerdu taking a deep breath as he was rather overwhelmed by
the power of the emotions that Thorin experienced making him hug Thorin
hard.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“What did you saw?” Thorin questioned.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The Tunnels… and what happened your parents” Kerdu answered while
bursting to tears.</p>
<p>Thorin grabbed Kerdu’s hand and returned his hug.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You don’t need this added pain for you to carry” Thorin comforted
Kerdu.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Well… Let’s carry it together.” Kerdu replied.</p>
